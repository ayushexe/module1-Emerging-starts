        Legendary South Africa captain Graeme Smith recently spoke about the future of Test cricket and also mentioned former India captain Virat Kohli in his comments.<br> While commentating during the 1st Test match between England and South Africa on Sky Sports, Smith reckoned that only five or six countries might be playing Test cricket in coming years. The 41-year-old Smith also mentioned how Kohli led Indiaâ€™s rise in red-ball cricket and India took the format seriously under his captaincy.<br>
        Virat took over the leadership of Indian Test squad, after MS Dhoni retired from the format in 2014. He led the team in a total of 68 Test matches till 2022 and is hailed as the most successful captain for Team India in red-ball cricket. His win percentage of 58.82% is unmatched by the legends like Dhoni, Sourav Ganguly, Mohammad Azharuddin and Sunil Gavaskar, who led India in 45+ Test matches.
